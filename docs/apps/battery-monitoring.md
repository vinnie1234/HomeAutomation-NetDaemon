# Battery Monitoring App

## Overview

The Battery Monitoring app continuously monitors the battery levels of all battery-powered devices in the home automation system. It provides proactive alerts when devices have low battery levels, ensuring that critical sensors and devices remain operational.

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Device Monitoring
- **Coverage**: Monitors all battery-powered devices registered in Home Assistant
- **Automatic Discovery**: Dynamically discovers and monitors new battery-powered devices
- **Device Types**: Sensors, buttons, smart locks, remotes, and other battery-powered devices

### Configurable Alert System
- **Threshold Configuration**: Customizable low battery warning level
- **Time-based Alerts**: Configurable check intervals to prevent notification spam
- **Smart Reset**: Automatically resets notifications when battery reaches 100%

### Intelligent Notification Management
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoids sending repeated notifications for the same device
- **Battery Level Tracking**: Monitors battery level changes over time
- **Notification Reset**: Clears alert history when battery is recharged

## Configuration

### App Configuration Settings
```json
{
    "Battery": {
        "WarningLevel": 20,
        "CheckInterval": 30
    }
}
```

### Parameters
- **WarningLevel**: Battery percentage threshold for low battery alerts (default: 20%)
- **CheckInterval**: Minutes between battery level checks (default: 30 minutes)

## Functionality

### Battery Level Monitoring
The app continuously monitors all devices with battery attributes:
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitors battery level changes as they occur
- **Threshold Detection**: Triggers alerts when battery drops below configured level
- **Duration Tracking**: Ensures battery has been low for specified duration before alerting

### Notification System
- **Phone Notifications**: Sends alerts directly to Vincent's phone
- **Battery Dashboard**: Provides quick access to battery status dashboard
- **Alert Content**: Includes device name, current battery level, and dashboard link

### Automatic Reset Logic
- **Full Charge Detection**: Monitors for batteries reaching 100%
- **Notification History Reset**: Clears alert history when device is recharged
- **Fresh Start**: Allows new alerts once battery is recharged and depletes again

## Technical Implementation

### Triggers
- Battery level changes on all monitored devices
- Scheduled checks based on configured interval
- Battery level reaching 100% for reset logic

### Actions
- Phone notifications with vibration patterns
- Dashboard link generation
- Notification history management
- Alert reset processing

### Data Persistence
- **Notification History**: Stores when alerts were sent for each device
- **Battery State Tracking**: Maintains battery level history
- **Reset State Management**: Tracks when devices have been recharged
