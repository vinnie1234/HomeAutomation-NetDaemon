# Bedroom Lights App

## Overview

The Bedroom Lights app is currently in development and serves as a placeholder for future bedroom lighting automation features. This app is part of the room-specific automation system and will provide intelligent lighting control for the bedroom environment.

## Current Status

**Development Phase**: Planning and design stage
- The app structure is in place but functionality is not yet implemented
- Inherits from the BaseApp framework for future expansion
- Ready for implementation of bedroom-specific automation features

## Planned Features

### Motion-Based Lighting
- **Motion Detection**: Automatic lighting when movement is detected
- **Sleep-Aware Brightness**: Different brightness levels based on sleep state
- **Gentle Wake-up**: Gradual lighting increase for morning routines
- **Night Navigation**: Minimal lighting for nighttime movement

### Sleep Integration
- **Bedtime Routines**: Automatic dimming for sleep preparation
- **Wake-up Sequences**: Coordinated with alarm and wake-up systems
- **Sleep State Coordination**: Integration with Sleep Manager app
- **Circadian Rhythm**: Color temperature adjustment throughout the day

### Smart Controls
- **Bedside Controls**: Integration with bedside switches and buttons
- **Voice Control**: Smart speaker integration for hands-free control
- **Phone Integration**: Control via mobile device when in bed
- **Scene Selection**: Predefined lighting scenes for different activities

### Environmental Awareness
- **House State Integration**: Coordination with central house state management
- **Time-Based Adjustments**: Different behavior for morning, day, evening, and night
- **Seasonal Adaptation**: Adjustments for changing daylight hours
- **Weather Integration**: Response to outdoor conditions

## Technical Framework

### BaseApp Integration
```csharp
[NetDaemonApp]
public class BedroomLights : BaseApp
{
    // Future implementation will include:
    // - Motion sensor integration
    // - Light entity control
    // - Sleep state monitoring
    // - Scene management
    // - User preference handling
}
```

### Planned Entities
- **Motion Sensors**: Bedroom motion detection
- **Light Entities**: Bedroom ceiling lights, bedside lamps, ambient lighting
- **Switch Controls**: Wall switches and bedside controls
- **Sleep Sensors**: Integration with sleep tracking
- **Environmental Sensors**: Light level and occupancy detection

### Configuration Structure
```json
{
    "BedroomLights": {
        "MotionSensor": "binary_sensor.bedroom_motion",
        "MainLight": "light.bedroom_ceiling",
        "BedsideLamps": ["light.bedside_left", "light.bedside_right"],
        "TimingDaytime": 900,
        "TimingNighttime": 300,
        "BrightnessDay": 100,
        "BrightnessNight": 5,
        "DisableOverride": "input_boolean.disable_bedroom_automation"
    }
}
```

## Design Considerations

### User Experience
- **Minimal Disruption**: Lighting should not disturb sleep or rest
- **Intuitive Control**: Natural and easy-to-use control methods
- **Personalization**: Adaptable to individual preferences and schedules
- **Reliability**: Consistent and dependable operation

### Technical Requirements
- **Low Latency**: Immediate response to user actions
- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimal power consumption
- **Fail-Safe Operation**: Graceful degradation when systems fail
- **Security**: Secure communication and control

### Integration Points
- **Sleep Manager**: Coordination with sleep and wake routines
- **House State Manager**: Integration with daily state transitions
- **Alarm System**: Coordination with wake-up alarms
- **Climate Control**: Integration with bedroom temperature management

## Testing Framework

### Planned Test Coverage
- Motion detection accuracy
- Sleep state integration
- Light control reliability
- Configuration management
- Error handling and recovery

### User Acceptance Testing
- Real-world usage scenarios
- User preference adaptation
- Performance under various conditions
- Integration with existing systems

## Documentation Updates

As the Bedroom Lights app is developed, this documentation will be updated to reflect:
- Implemented features and functionality
- Configuration options and settings
- Usage examples and best practices
- Troubleshooting guides and maintenance procedures

The Bedroom Lights app represents the future expansion of room-specific automation, designed to provide intelligent, personalized, and seamless lighting control for the most personal space in the home.
