            "ButtonEntity": "input_button.vacuum_hall",
            "RegionIds": ["20"]
        },
        "LitterBox": {
            "ButtonEntity": "input_button.vacuum_litter_box",
            "RegionIds": ["21"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Skip Configuration
- **Global Skip**: Disable all automatic cleaning
- **Zone-specific Skip**: Disable cleaning for specific areas
- **Time-based Skip**: Temporary disable during specific periods

## Technical Implementation

### Zone Control System
- **Button Triggers**: Physical and virtual button press detection
- **Region Mapping**: Translates rooms to vacuum map regions
- **Command Generation**: Creates zone-specific cleaning commands
- **Status Monitoring**: Tracks cleaning progress and completion

### Automatic Triggers
- **Litter Box Monitoring**: Detects when litter box cleaning cycle completes
- **Delay Logic**: Waits appropriate time before starting vacuum
- **Conflict Resolution**: Prevents multiple simultaneous cleaning requests
- **Error Handling**: Manages failed cleaning attempts

### Sleep Integration
- **Sleep State Detection**: Monitors current sleep state
- **Time Restrictions**: Prevents cleaning during quiet hours
- **Schedule Coordination**: Coordinates with daily routines
- **Override Prevention**: Blocks inappropriate automatic activation

## Cleaning Zones

### Kitchen Zone
- **Region ID**: 18
- **Coverage**: Kitchen floor area, under appliances
- **Frequency**: High-traffic area, frequent cleaning
- **Triggers**: Manual button, spill detection

### Living Room Zone
- **Region IDs**: 16, 17
- **Coverage**: Main seating area, entertainment center
- **Frequency**: Daily cleaning recommended
- **Triggers**: Manual button, scheduled cleaning

### Bedroom Zone
- **Region ID**: 19
- **Coverage**: Bedroom floor, under bed
- **Frequency**: Weekly or as needed
- **Triggers**: Manual button only (respects sleep)

### Hall Zone
- **Region ID**: 20
- **Coverage**: Hallway, transition areas
- **Frequency**: High-traffic, frequent cleaning
- **Triggers**: Manual button, motion-based

### Litter Box Zone
- **Region ID**: 21
- **Coverage**: Cat litter area, surrounding floor
- **Frequency**: After each litter box cleaning
- **Triggers**: Automatic after litter box cycle

## Automation Logic

### Litter Box Cleaning Sequence
1. **Detection**: PetSnowy litter box completes cleaning cycle
2. **Delay**: Wait for dust and debris to settle
3. **Sleep Check**: Verify not in sleep mode
4. **Skip Check**: Confirm automatic cleaning is enabled
5. **Execution**: Start vacuum cleaning for litter box area
6. **Monitoring**: Track cleaning completion

### Manual Zone Cleaning
1. **Button Press**: User activates zone cleaning button
2. **Zone Lookup**: Map button to specific region IDs
3. **Status Check**: Verify vacuum is available
4. **Command Send**: Execute zone-specific cleaning command
5. **Feedback**: Provide cleaning status updates

### Conflict Resolution
- **Multiple Requests**: Queue cleaning requests appropriately
- **Busy Vacuum**: Handle vacuum already in use
- **Low Battery**: Defer cleaning until charged
- **Error States**: Manage vacuum errors and recovery

## Integration

### Home Assistant Entities
- **Vacuum Entity**: Robot vacuum device control
- **Button Entities**: Zone cleaning trigger buttons
- **Sleep Boolean**: Sleep state monitoring
- **Skip Booleans**: Override controls for automatic cleaning
- **PetSnowy Sensors**: Litter box status monitoring

### Smart Home Devices
