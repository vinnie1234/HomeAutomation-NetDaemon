# Google Assistant Button Translate App

## Overview

Translates Google Assistant voice commands and input boolean states to appropriate automation actions within the NetDaemon system.

## Purpose

The Google Assistant Button Translate App serves as a bridge between voice commands and the home automation system, providing intelligent translation of voice commands to specific automation actions and managing the interaction between input booleans and input buttons.

## Translation Logic

### Command Processing Pipeline
1. **Voice Recognition**: Google Assistant processes natural language
2. **Intent Classification**: System classifies command intent and category
3. **Parameter Extraction**: Extracts relevant parameters from command
4. **Action Mapping**: Maps to specific NetDaemon automation actions
5. **Execution**: Executes the translated automation command

### Boolean to Button Mapping
- **State Synchronization**: Maintains synchronization between boolean and button states
- **Trigger Management**: Manages trigger events for button activations
- **Feedback Loops**: Provides feedback on action completion
- **Error Handling**: Handles conflicts and invalid state combinations

## Supported Commands

### Natural Language Examples
- **"Turn on the living room lights"** → Activates living room lighting
- **"Clean the kitchen"** → Initiates vacuum cleaning in kitchen
- **"Feed the cat"** → Triggers cat feeding automation
- **"Play relaxing music"** → Activates relaxing music scene
- **"Set bedroom to movie mode"** → Activates bedroom movie scene

### Technical Commands
- **"Activate scene [scene_name]"** → Direct scene activation
- **"Set [device] to [state]"** → Direct device control
- **"Run [automation_name]"** → Direct automation execution
- **"Check [device] status"** → Status query commands
